/// A struct that creates c-code for converting a unit between it's signed and unsigned variants.
/// A unit may need to be represented as a different type in the c-implementation. The functions in
/// this struct perform a cast into the desired unit without performing any unit conversions.
struct SignConverter {

    /// Change the sign of some unit. This function assumes you are converting to the same unit
    /// (eg. centimetres to centimetres). The purpose of this function is to change the
    /// underlying C-type. A typical use-case is to assist a user who requires more precision; so they
    /// might need to convert a centimetres_t into a centimetres_d (int to double). This function is
    /// used to generate the c-style cast for this type of conversion.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - str: The unit to convert.
    ///   - otherUnit: The equivalent unit to convert into.
    ///   - sign: The sign of the current unit.
    ///   - otherSign: The sign of the new unit.
    /// - Returns: A string of generated c-code that will convert *str* to the correct unit.
    /// - Warning: This function assumes that you are converting to the same unit, just with a different
    ///            type (i.e. there is no unit conversion being performed in this function).
    ///            The result of the cast will be incorrect if this is not the case.
